value inside software releases, automating feature release through pipelines,
that can test hypothesis faster allowing higher adaptability using &ldquo;fail-fast&rdquo;
approaches. Those changes are more cultural than technical, so it&rsquo;s normal to
see DevOps being called culture.</p><p>The implementation of DevOps happens through processes automation, having a
strong sense of processes re-engineering inside the company. Comparing to the
cultural change, the technical is easy to implement. Therefore the role that a
&ldquo;DevOps Engineer/Analyst&rdquo; performs is very confusing, which enables many
SysAdmins and Infra Analysts assuming the role of &ldquo;DevOps.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=lean-is-the-basis-of-agile>Lean is the basis of Agile</h2><p>Reality is not as happy as it sounds. After World War II, Japan was destroyed
and under-resourced after losing the war. With a limited amount of resources,
the country needed to reinvent itself and survive after a time of severe
depression. During that time two guys gained attention inside a company that
later gave its name after the methodology.</p><p>Those guys were Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno, inside Toyota Motor Corporation.
They&rsquo;re the founders of the &ldquo;Toyota production model&rdquo; also known as Toyotism.</p><h2 id=toyota-gave-birth-to-lean>Toyota gave birth to Lean</h2><p>Lean teaches how to optimize the end-to-end process, focusing on processes that
create value for customers. Bottlenecks in the process must be removed, and
wasteful activities need to be identified and avoided. Both explained and
defined by LEAN 3M: Muda, Mura, and Muri.</p><p>Also teaches to improve yourself day after day and always focus on quality
through Kaizen (continuous improvement).</p><p>Japanese culture truly believes that quality is the main objective to deliver
value to customers since quality is what brings your clients back.</p><h2 id=kaizen>Kaizen</h2><p>A mindset that helps to look at each part of the process exclusively and think
about the improvements. Involving the people who are part of the process,
encourage the inclusion of these people in the decisions of change, since:</p><ul><li>It is much easier to accept a change when it is not imposed (top-down);</li><li>There is a greater absorption of change by people when they&rsquo;re included in the
planning;</li><li>The people who are involved in the process bring their concerns and
suggestions, which contribute positively to the evolution of the change,
making the idea more robust.</li></ul><p>The process of defining improvements through Kaizen happens (usually) in the
following order:</p><ol><li>Define data-driven objectives;</li><li>Review the current state and develop an improvement plan;</li><li>Implement improvement;</li><li>Review the implementation and improve what does not work;</li><li>Report the results and determine the items to be monitored.</li></ol><p>This process is also called <strong>PDCA: Plain-Do-Control-Act</strong>, which is summarized
in:</p><ul><li>Plan (develop the hypothesis);</li><li>Do (experiment);</li><li>Check (validate results);</li><li>Act (refine the experiment and start over).</li></ul><h1 id=3m-muda-mura-muri>3M: Muda, Mura, Muri</h1><h2 id=muda-waste>Muda (waste)</h2><p>Any activity that consumes time without adding value to the final consumer. e.g.:</p><ul><li>over-production;</li><li>idle time in the process;</li><li>products with a defect.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that there are different levels of Muda that can be
removed quickly or not, and the classification depends on the time for removal.</p><p>An example of a more time-consuming Muda is the discontinuation of legacy
software that ends up with longer release cycles, causing teams to be idle,
followed by an often long or manual test routine.</p><h2 id=mura-unevenness>Mura (unevenness)</h2><p>Unevenness in operation, caused by activities that are very changeable and
unpredictable, generating different results in all executions. e.g., the
execution of tasks that were not well planned and ended up arriving with strict
deadlines. The team runs in the rush, generating exhaustion, despair, and
moreover, when finished leaves the people who have performed these tasks waiting
(for feedback, or confirmation that it is completed).</p><h2 id=muri-overload>Muri (overload)</h2><p>Overburdening equipment or operators by requiring them to run at a higher or
harder pace beyond the limit, to achieve some goal or expectation, causing
fatigue and consequently failures during the process. These failures are usually
human errors caused by fatigue during overwork.</p><h2 id=back-to-agile>Back to Agile</h2><p>In 2000 a group of 17 people met at a resort in Oregon to talk about ideas that
could improve the flow of software development. After a year of mature ideas,
these people met again and published the ideas, which we now know as <strong>Agile
Manifesto</strong>.</p><p>Main points are:</p><p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools <strong>Working software</strong>
over comprehensive documentation <strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract
negotiation <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</p><p>I will restrict the explanation of these points with the DevOps point of view,
keeping on track (now).</p><h2 id=individuals-and-interactions>Individuals and interactions</h2><p><em>over processes and tools</em></p><p>First comes the individuals, they should receive the necessary tooling to work
with, and then be empowered to do their jobs. Interactions between people are
greatly encouraged, for sharing knowledge and also for facilitating creative
flow within development teams.</p><p>An excellent example of interaction encouraged through DevOps is the code review
habit. Considering that small parts of the software will be iterated and
approved in the pipeline passing through different environments, automatically,
the best way to prevent defects is through code review.</p><p>This habit brings benefits such as:</p><ul><li>Knowledge sharing;</li><li>Observation of the problem from a different point of view;</li><li>Team engagement;</li><li>Lesser bugs.</li></ul><h2 id=working-software>Working software</h2><p><em>over comprehensive documentation</em></p><p>Here&rsquo;s a trick in &ldquo;working software,&rdquo; software that works is not code that
compiles. The software that works is what meets the requirements of the user;
i.e., the software that solves the problem and the pains of the user.</p><p>As the market is very dynamic, and evolves with high speed, often during the
software development project the requirements change due to external factors.
Therefore, knowing that it is not possible to predict all the elements, many
&ldquo;workarounds&rdquo; are made during development and documented. Passing the
responsibility to the user to handle the faults, and perform the workarounds,
expending more effort than would be required to perform the tasks using the
software.</p><blockquote><p>Deliver a working software frequently, ranging from a few weeks to a few months, considering shorter time-scale. - Agile Manifesto</p></blockquote><p>Encouraging as many deployments as possible, so that failures happen as early as
possible, thus allowing their impact to be much less.</p><h1 id=fail-fast>Fail-fast!</h1><p>Failures are understood and encouraged because it&rsquo;s part of the mindset. Because:</p><ul><li>Only those who <strong>do</strong> make mistakes;</li><li>Failures are the best opportunity for learning and evolving;</li><li>Shit happens.</li></ul><p>Nothing like quoting Murphy&rsquo;s law to contextualize</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s best for failures to occur early, while the cost of correction
is still low. Failing a controlled testing environment allows the fix to be much
faster (and cheaper) than it would if the fix were already in production.</p><p>For this approach to succeed, there is a premise that environments are
production copies, or at least as close as possible. Otherwise, there will be
behavioral changes in the software between the environments, making the test
environment unfeasible.</p><p>If the environments are divergent, the promotion of bugs for production will be
very frequent, causing late failures, which are expensive failures.</p><h2 id=customer--collaboration>Customer collaboration</h2><p><em>over contract negotiation</em></p><p>Know your client! Including it in the process is the best approach to have
working software. After iterating over deliverables, it&rsquo;s essential to create a
positive feedback loop with your client, bringing it as close as possible to the
development of the tools that he/she is going to use.</p><p>We can describe this situation with:</p><ul><li>From point A it is possible to see only point B;</li><li>From point B it is possible to see point C;</li></ul><p>Therefore there is a great incentive for the software to be delivered in parts,
continuously. Thus gathering user feedback on the next steps, following the
concepts of evolutionary prototyping, which were widely publicized through <a href=http://theleanstartup.com/book target=_blank rel=noopener><em>The
Lean Startup</em></a>.</p><p>This point contrasts sharply with the previous one about continuous release, so
that it is possible to present the prototype and evolve it throughout the
project.</p><p>Learn who your customer/consumer/user is, and whom you are making the software
for, as this is the only way you can deliver value to that customer. An
essential part of the software development process is to be empathic with user
problems, and to truly understand what the problem is to be solved, and the
result of the impact on software development (value creation for the user).</p><h2 id=responding-to-change>Responding to change</h2><p><em>over following a plan</em></p><p>Redesigning the requirements overtime is part of the job, and a necessary step
to success. If you want to build something useful that is going to grow and have
absorption, it&rsquo;s a key feature to include your client in the implementation
process.</p><p>It will be the only way to bring all the problems of the user to the table and
create the best solution for all these problems because the user is the only
person that knows the real challenges he faces in their routine dealing with
software.</p><p>With continuous delivery of software along with monitoring results, the process
of collecting feedback is much simpler and faster.</p><h1 id=devops-devops-devops>DevOps, DevOps, DevOps</h1><p>With the popularization of DevOps, a lot of disagreement came out there followed
by a significant confusion about the subject. It is very common to come across
different interpretations of <strong>what is DevOps</strong>. There is a lot of euphemism in
the area, and gourmetization on LinkedIn, with many SysAdmins calling themselves
DevOps since they learned to code shell script inside Python.</p><p>Do you want to keep reading? <a href=https://macunha.me/en/post/2019/01/devops-benefits/>Here are the benefits of adopting DevOps techniques.</a></p></div><div class=article-tags><a class="badge badge-light" href=https://macunha.me/en/tag/devops/>devops</a>
