&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to be able to innovate and maintain itself in a highly changing
and evolving market, Dotz went through a process of digital
transformation and had the help of some consultants along the way. Among
the steps to get closer to a digital model, the implementation of a Data
Lake emerged, with the requirements of being
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serverless&lt;/a> and cloud-native
to support the decision making process and shorten time-to-market during
the launch of a new products.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem">Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dotz is one of the largest companies in the field of loyalty program in
Brazil, and they&amp;rsquo;d face a high number of issues with data disconnection
making it difficult to analyze their users' behaviors. Since they
received data from numerous supermarkets and stores, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to
clusterizate products, since the name is different depending on the
source. To help with this analysis, they decided to build a Data Lake.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We built and deployed a Big Data's managed architecture using Google's
Cloud Platform (GCP) to support this strategy and allow a 360-degree
view of customers (users with points a.k.a. Dotz) and partners (the
supermarkets offering the loyalty program).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design was focused on cloud-managed services and serverless computing
offered by Google, serving the core competencies of a Data Lake such as
scalable storage using Google Cloud Storage, and Google BigQuery. With
part of the process running inside Kubernetes, responsible for data
cleansing ETL flow management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We streamed data with Apache Beam running under Google DataFlow,
parallel mass processing with Apache Spark jobs running on Google
DataProc, exploratory analysis with Google DataLab, Machine Learning
Analysis with Google ML and Data visualization in Google Data Studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data is transported using an event-driven model, where every data is
collected using a streaming model, even the ETL (which runs on a
micro-batch, to enable near real-time exploration). These data goes
through the data pipeline using Google Pub/Sub message-oriented
middleware, and every message is serialized using Avro format, which
reduces the payload and allows transportation to be cost-effective, fast
and reliable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="impact-and-results">Impact and results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It all allowed Dotz to have a better structure on their analytical
platform, previously managed inside a large MS SQL Server instance,
which moved to a Data Lake with layers allowing data categorization,
governance, quality and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supporting analytical processes of users data, faster exploration and
monetization of their knowledge on customers' behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easynvest Data Platform</title><link>https://macunha.me/en/project/2017/easynvest-data-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://macunha.me/en/project/2017/easynvest-data-platform/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Within Easynvest&amp;rsquo;s annual planning, an investment in the expansion of
data &amp;amp; analytics team aimed at shortening decision making process and
in delivering a higher quality to customers through a low cost operational
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the main objectives of this project, we had the automation of
credit analysis (executed during the approval of customer registration, using Machine
Learning), a process that until then was long and manual, being handled
by the back office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Followed by a better offer of products to the client, carrying out the
categorization according to the profile of each customer, allowing suggestions
of more attractive products, in line with personal preferences,
as well as according to the profile of each investor (conservative, moderate
or aggressive).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, the intelligent detection of money laundry and
reporting to the responsible authorities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem">Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>However, there were limitations in the data tools, mainly due to the
fact that they were proprietary software (with limited licenses) and
designed for usage inside data centers. In addition, the analytical
database was modeled for traditional Business Intelligence models
(OLAP, etc), making the decision making process heavy, due to the
demanding amount of interactions during ETL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously for a client to be approved, the process took 10 to 15 days.
Gathering all necessary information, providing a complete perspective of
the profile, including credit analysis. After collecting the information,
the back office generated an internal credit analysis score.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In most cases, the client was not notified of updates regarding the
process and did not receive feedback at the end (if refused) unless
explicitly requested (by contacting support via chat or email, for
example) which made the process time consuming and costly. Not to
mention the countless amounts of customers lost to the competition during
this long wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make it possible, we built an hybrid-cloud implementation using AWS
cloud-based components (mainly AWS S3, EMR and ECS), to extend the data
centers' capability, implementing a cloud-first Hadoop ecosystem
(replacing the proprietary software components with open-source
equivalents). Giving Easynvest the possibility to grow the Data Lake
exponentially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Data Lake design was robust, aimed to handle the execution of heavy
analytical processes through Machine Learning models, with support for
data quality, metadata governance, information security and data serving
(data owners could share data with consumers from other areas within the
company, allowing to self-service their analytical data).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Chatbot was also used to reduce the operational load in the
environment, this bot is responsible for maintaining and updating
infrastructure components. From triggering deployments to generating
encryption keys on-demand for data security and governance. Implemented
with the Errbot framework for Python interacting with Slack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going further, we implemented the best practices in DevOps, using Jenkins
as a tool for CI/CD of the developed components alongside with Ansible for
Configuration Management.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="impact-and-results">Impact and results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks to the utilization of layers in the Data Lake and the
implementation of data pipelines, we were able to reduce the data
ingestion time by 78% and to include metadata and data catalog, in
addition to automating much of the work that used to be done manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus bringing positive results, especially reducing the registration
approval time for consumers from roughly 10 days to 1 day. It also made
the data platform more democratic, providing relevant information that
facilitates the analysis of areas such as risk (credit analysis) and
support, without having to give up security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
